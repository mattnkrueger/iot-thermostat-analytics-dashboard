# ECE-Senior-Design-Lab-1 (Extension Application)

To move past a prototype and build a more robust system, a second application was created with support for further iterations of the project in mind. Having already completed the base requirements, this application was purely experimental and aimed at how we could improve the system. 

Keeping the embedded system the relatively unchanged, the new software application consists of five components: a dedicated entry point for streaming data (1) into a Redis cache (2), a PostgreSQL database to store temperature readings and user information (3), and an asynchronous task queue to handle processes with high overhead â€“ such as database calls and SMTP - in the background (4), and a web application that serves a dashboard designed for mobile devices (5). The components were containerized using Docker to for ease of development, deployment, and scalability.  

With this extensible foundation, any smart-home application is straightforward and highly configurable; Adding an additional sensor (thermometer, humidity, air quality, etc) just means adding new endpoints to handle sensor information within the Streamer API service, creating a new stream, and creating a new table within the database. The additional sensor information can then be used for analytics and real-time operations in response to external sensor readings.

# Running the Project
We cannot share our physical box, but we can share all you need to run the project in a dummy environment :)

## Prerequisites
This repository contains submodules which must be initialized.

After pulling this repository, run the following command:
```
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

You must also have Docker installed on your computer to spin up the application locally. Please read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) on how to get started.

## Starting Docker Containers:
After initializing the submodules and downloading Docker, simply run the command:
```
docker compose up
```

## Viewing the Dashboard
Running the container will expose port 8000 which your mobile device can connect to. 

To find your devices IP, use the following command:

**MacOS**: `ipconfig getifaddr en0`

**Linux**: `ip addr show`

**Windows**: `ipconfig`

Then, within your mobile browser, enter the path:

```
<IP>:8000    
```
ex: 127.0.0.1:8000 (this can be used for viewing on machine running the containers)

_(alternatively, you can open the computer running the container but the CSS is not configured for larger screens and will not look as nice)_
